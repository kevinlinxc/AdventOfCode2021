# Advent of Code 2021 
This repo is for the annual Advent of Code programming challenge, 2021 version. 

This year, I wanted to brush up on C++ and Java, so on certain days when I had more time I decided to use them instead 
of my main language (Python). This resulted in a disgusting file structure with multiple build systems. 
My C++ compilation broke on day 5 when I tried to include the Boost package, so I stopped using it temporarily. 

Nevertheless, I plan on actually completing AoC for the first time ever and I'm expecting to gain a lot of needed 
familiarity with C++ and Java.
